Loom is a sample bank specifically tied to multiple musical compositions, keeping everything organized and easy to access. These samples are shared with the community, and you are free to use, remix, or adapt them for your own music projects. While each set of samples is intended for a specific composition, youâ€™re welcome to incorporate them however you wish into your creative work.
