Loom is a sample bank designed to organize specific sounds into separate folders, ensuring they remain categorized and don’t get mixed up. Each folder contains samples that are specifically tied to a particular musical composition, keeping everything organized and easy to access.
These samples are shared with the community, and you are free to use, remix, or adapt them for your own music projects. While each set of samples is intended for a specific composition, you’re welcome to incorporate them however you wish in your creative work.
