Loom is a sample bank specifically tied to multiple musical compositions, keeping everything organized and easy to access. Loom allows for the separation of samples used in the "Garden" from those intended for specific compositions. This ensures that the order of the samples is preserved, preventing any disruption in the code and allowing "Garden" to be populated with new samples without breaking the structure meant for the music projects.

These samples are shared with the community, and you are free to use, remix, or adapt them for your own music projects. While each set of samples is intended for a specific composition, youâ€™re welcome to incorporate them however you wish into your creative work.
